 The most important part of the bicycle is the brake system. Only a minimum maintenance of the brake system is necessary. But, when a problem does occur, make sure you to do the necessary maintenance as quickly as possible. If you do not do this the bicycle will be dangerous to use. 
 There are nine different types of brake systems. The one found on most bicycles is the cantilever brake (refer to ). 
 Cantilever brake: 
 The brake system (refer to ) has these primary components:  
 the brake lever (refer to ) 
 the brake cable 
 the brake arm 
 the brake clamp (also known as callipers) 
 the brake pads (refer to ) 
 Cantilever brake with straddle cable: 
 A cable that goes from the brake levers on the handlebars pulls the two levers on the brakes together. This presses the brake pads against the outer rim of the wheel, which decreases the speed of the bicycle. 
 Brake pads: 
 There are four brake pads (refer to ) on the bicycle. Two are found on the front wheel and two on the rear wheel. The brake pads are made out of hard wearing rubber. The pads press against the rim of the wheel to cause friction when the you operate the brake levers. 
 Exploded diagram of a brake: 
 Brake lever: 
 The brake levers (refer to ) are easily damaged. The lever is installed in the mount. A clamp bolt holds the mount. This bolt is not visible because it is found in the mount. The lever turns on a lever pivot bolt. The adjuster lock nut holds the brake cable. This lock nut adjusts the tension of the cable.

 Below is a list of the different bicycle components and a functional description of them.  
 the frame is the skeleton of the bicycle. refer to  
 the wheel is the point of contact between the bicycle and the road for the bicycle to have movement. refer to  
 the spokes are thick wires with tension applied that connect the hub to the rim. you can adjust the tension with the nipple on the rim side. 
 the hub attaches to the center of the wheel where the axle and the bearings are. 
 the metal rim is a metal ring that has a u-shaped cross section to hold the spokes on the inner side and the tire on the outer side. 
 the seat, which is also known as the ""saddle"", is used as the support platform for the person to sit on the bicycle. 
 the seat post is used as a support post for the seat and to change the height of the seat for the rider. 
 the handle bar is a horizontal bar with handles on each end. the handle bar is a steering mechanism that the rider uses to change the direction of the bicycle. the brake levers are also on the handle bar. refer to  
 the handle bar stem (the stem) attaches the handle bar to the steering tube. refer to  
 when you operate the brake lever, the brake pads move against the wheel to decrease the speed. the brake lever on the left side operates the front brake. the brake lever on the right side operates the rear brake. 
 when you operate the brakes, the brake pad moves against the wheel to decrease the speed of the bicycle. refer to  
 the shifters are the mechanisms that you use to change the gears on the bicycle. there are 7 different types of shifters that have been developed over the years, but they all have the same functionality. when you operate the shifters, they pull the control cable to move the derailleur towards a larger diameter chain ring. the shifters can also loosen the cable to let the derailleur move towards a smaller diameter chain ring. refer to  
 the crank moves the power to the chain rings when the pedals operate. 
 the pedals move the force of movement from the feet to the cranks. 
 the chain moves the power from the chain rings to the cogs on the freewheel. refer to  
 the gears have different mechanisms that function together to change the speed of the bicycle. these mechanisms include:  
 the sprockets 
 the chain 
 the derailleur 
 the chain rings (also known as the ""chain wheel"") pull on the chain when the cranks turn. 
 a derailleur moves the chain from one sprocket to another to change the gears. there are two different types of derailleur, the front and the rear. the highest ratio (highest gear) is when the chain is on the largest sprocket on the front and the smallest at the rear. to get the lowest gear, the smallest sprocket is at the front and the largest at the rear. refer to ";DMC-S1000DBIKE-A-D00-00-00-00AA-042A-AAA(1)

 The wheel (refer to ) of a bicycle is a complex structure. The wheel assembly has these parts:  
 the tire 
 the tube 
 the spokes 
 the spoke nipples 
 the valve 
 the hub 
 Parts of the wheel: 
 Spokes: 
 The spokes go out from the hub and go across and below each other. The spoke nipples attach the spokes to the rim with the threads on the end of the spokes. You can use the spoke nipples to adjust the tension of the spokes. The tension on each of the spokes must be equal. 
 Wheel rim: 
 The rim (refer to ) of the wheel has a lining of rim tape. This tape protects the tube from damage that the rough edges on the spoke nipples can cause. 
 The tire and rim: 
 Tube and tire: 
 The tube and the tire install on the rim. The sidewalls of the tire have markings on them. These which are used to indicate the correct direction of rotation. The markings also make sure the tire installs on the rim and that the directional arrows points in the correct direction. You install the tube into the tire before you inflate it. The tube has a valve (refer to ) which you put through the hole in the rim. This valve (refer to ) is used to inflate the tube and the tire to the correct pressure.

 The wheel (refer to ) of a bicycle is a complex structure. The wheel assembly has these parts:  
 the tire 
 the tube 
 the spokes 
 the spoke nipples 
 the valve 
 the hub 
 Parts of the wheel: 
 Spokes: 
 The spokes go out from the hub and go across and below each other. The spoke nipples attach the spokes to the rim with the threads on the end of the spokes. You can use the spoke nipples to adjust the tension of the spokes. The tension on each of the spokes must be equal. 
 Wheel rim: 
 The rim (refer to ) of the wheel has a lining of rim tape. This tape protects the tube from damage that the rough edges on the spoke nipples can cause. 
 The tire and rim: 
 Tube and tire: 
 The tube and the tire install on the rim. The sidewalls of the tire have markings on them. These which are used to indicate the correct direction of rotation. The markings also make sure the tire installs on the rim and that the directional arrows points in the correct direction. You install the tube into the tire before you inflate it. The tube has a valve (refer to ) which you put through the hole in the rim. This valve (refer to ) is used to inflate the tube and the tire to the correct pressure. A dust cap installs on the valve (refer to ) to prevent damage that dust and debris can cause.

 The most important part of the bicycle is the brake system. Only a minimum maintenance of the brake system is necessary. But, when a problem does occur, make sure you to do the necessary maintenance as quickly as possible. If you do not do this the bicycle will be dangerous to use. 
 There are nine different types of brake systems. The one found on most bicycles is the cantilever brake (refer to ). 
 Cantilever brake: 
 The brake system (refer to ) has these primary components:  
 the brake lever (refer to ) 
 the brake cable 
 the brake arm 
 the brake clamp (also known as callipers) 
 the brake pads (refer to ) 
 Cantilever brake with straddle cable: 
 A cable that goes from the brake levers on the handlebars pulls the two levers on the brakes together. This presses the brake pads against the outer rim of the wheel, which decreases the speed of the bicycle. 
 Brake pads: 
 There are four brake pads (refer to ) on the bicycle. Two are found on the front wheel and two on the rear wheel. The brake pads are made out of hard wearing rubber. The pads press against the rim of the wheel to cause friction when the you operate the brake levers. 
 Exploded diagram of a brake: 
 Brake lever: 
 The brake levers (refer to ) are easily damaged. The lever is installed in the mount. A clamp bolt holds the mount. This bolt is not visible because it is found in the mount. The lever turns on a lever pivot bolt. The adjuster lock nut holds the brake cable. This lock nut adjusts the tension of the cable.

 The headset (refer to ) is a pair of bearings on the two ends of the head tube of the frame. These bearings permit the fork to turn rearward and forward (for example, to let the rider turn the handlebars for the steering). 
 The headset (refer to ) includes the parts that follow:  
 The bearing races that push into the head tube 
 a bearing race that pushes on the fork steerer tube 
 an adjustable upper race 
 two sets of ball bearings 
 A headset has cups that are pushed into the head tube and a ring on the fork. All three must be fully parallel. It is usually necessary to remove rough paint to get all three fully parallel. 
 The upper race installs onto the steerer tube with a thread. A locknut is used to safety the upper race. 
 A clamp bolt holds the stem to the steerer tube. 
 The fourth remaining bearing race is part of a nut that installs on the threaded top end of the fork. This is done after you install it in the head tube. It is sometimes necessary for some headsets to have more thread at the top of the head tube. If the fork is too long, the spacer rings can be installed. If it is too short, there is a limit to the number of headsets you can use.

 The headset (refer to ) is a pair of bearings on the two ends of the head tube of the frame. These bearings permit the fork to turn rearward and forward (for example, to let the rider turn the handlebars for the steering). 
 The headset (refer to ) includes the parts that follow:  
 The bearing races that push into the head tube 
 a bearing race that pushes on the fork steerer tube 
 an adjustable upper race 
 two sets of ball bearings 
 A headset has cups that are pushed into the head tube and a ring on the fork. All three must be fully parallel. It is usually necessary to remove rough paint to get all three fully parallel. 
 The upper race installs onto the steerer tube with a thread. A locknut is used to safety the upper race. 
 A clamp bolt holds the stem to the steerer tube. 
 The fourth remaining bearing race is part of a nut that installs on the threaded top end of the fork. This is done after you install it in the head tube. It is sometimes necessary for some headsets to have more thread at the top of the head tube. If the fork is too long, the spacer rings can be installed. If it is too short, there is a limit to the number of headsets you can use.

 There are two different types of derailleur, the front and the rear. 
 Front derailleur: 
 The front derailleur (refer to ) contains two types of screws to keep the movement of the derailleur to a minimum. These screws are:  
 the stop screw low-gear 
 the stop screw high-gear 
 The function of these screws is to prevent the rider from over shifting . If this occurs, the chain will go out of the chain wheel. 
 Front derailleur: 
 The derailleur is installed on the bicycle seat tube with a clamp and is parallel to the three front sprockets. 
 The shift cable is connected between the shifters on the handle bars and the cable clamp bolt on the front derailleur. This operates the derailleur. On the sprockets there is an inner and outer cage. The clamp attaches the cage. 
 Rear derailleur: 
 The rear derailleur (refer to ) section contains the sprockets for the different gear changes. When the cable clamp bolt is tight, it holds the shift cable in its position. A screwed bolt holds the tension wheel. 
 Rear derailleur: 
 The derailleur mounting bolt connects the derailleur to the frame. When the user attaches this bolt, this makes sure that the cage plates are parallel with the chain rings. 
 The guide wheel has the function to move the chain with the derailleur. It moves the chain from one sprocket to the other. The guide wheel must not move on its axis. If this occurs, there will be wear on the wheel. The position of the guide wheel is below the largest sprocket.";DMC-S1000DBIKE-A-DA5-10-00-00AA-041A-AAA(1)

 The thumb shifter is a usual type in modern bicycles. It is possible to adjust this type of shifter for operation in the index position or in the friction position. The differences between the two are:  
 The index shifters change the gears with a click of a lever. 
 The friction shifters hold the derailleur in its position by friction. 
 The thumb shifters (refer to ) are held on the bicycle with a screw. The paragraph that follows gives a description of a thumb shifter. 
 Thumb shifter index type: 
 How a thumb shifter is made up: 
 A wing nut (refer to ) from the top of the lever holds the thumb shifter. The lever is on top of the mount and the mount is on the handle bar with a nut. To remove the mount, it is necessary to loosen the nut of two turns (refer to ), then the mount can move from the handle bar from the top of the lever. The lever sits on top of the mount and the mount is fixed into pace on the handle bar by a nut. 
 Unscrew wingnut: 
 Loosen the nut: 
 On modern models of this shifter, there is a clamp bolt that holds the shifter in its position (refer to ). The user can loosen the clamp bolt with an applicable tool. This lets the shifter release the handlebar.
